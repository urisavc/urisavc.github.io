		<p>The Vanguard Cabinet (VC), a URISA initiative, is an advisory board made up of passionate, young geospatial 
		professionals who strive to engage young practitioners, increase their numbers in the organization, and better 
		understand the concerns facing these future leaders of the geospatial community. The VC's mission is to 
		collaborate with URISA’s Board of Directors and URISA committees in creating and promoting programs and policies 
		of benefit to young professionals and to enhance overall innovation, collaboration, networking, and professional 
		development opportunities.</p> 

		<p>URISA members who are age 35 and under are encouraged to apply for membership to the VC. Each year, 5-6 young 
		professionals will be selected by the Steering Committee and each will serve a 2-year term (the application process 
		begins each fall). In recognition of their service, each VC member will be offered a free GIS-Pro conference 
		registration during their term. Additionally, one VC member will be chosen as the URISA Young Professional of 
		the Year and will be awarded free tuition to the URISA Leadership Academy.</p>
